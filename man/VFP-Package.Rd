\description{
 The intended use of this package is to implement variance functions proposed in Sadler's VFP stand-alone software 
 (see reference below), from which the name was borrowed as well. 
 Main function of this package is \code{\link{fit.vfp}} for fitting non-linear variance-function
 models. Usually, these models are fitted to analysis-results of precision performance data e.g.
 frequently generated for in-vitro diagnostics (IVD). R-package VFP is designed to work best on objects 
 of class 'VCA' as generated by R-package \code{VCA} but it is not restricted to these.
 There are several functions operating on S3-objects of class 'VFP', e.g. \code{\link{plot.VFP}},
 \code{\link{print.VFP}}, \code{\link{summary.VFP}}, and \code{\link{predict.VFP}}. Function \code{\link{predictMean}}
 is of special interest when a functional relationship is used to derive limit of quantitation (LoQ) or functional
 sensitivity, as the concentration at which the IVD-imprecision expressed as coefficient of variation (CV) undercuts
 a specific threshold.
